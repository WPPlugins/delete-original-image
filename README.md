This plugin allows you to automatically delete the original image after upload, or do it in bulk for old images.

== Description ==

Delete Original Image is a Wordpress plugin to delete the the original image file uploaded. The problem that solves,

is that the original image file is usually huge (can be >6MB if it is a photograph) and it is never published on the pages

so there is no need to keep it on your server, and it it a must to delete it, if you have limited storage space and you are uploading

tons of pictures.

The plugin gives you the option to enable/disable this, to be done automatically when you upload an image.

And/or you can do it in bulk for all your previously uploaded images.

Specifically, this plugin copy the 'large' image ( i.e: your-pic-1038x576.jpg ) to the original file path ( i.e.: your-pic.jpg ), doing so,

Nothing should brake, all other plugins should keep working, but you need to know that the original image is no longer available on your site.
